        Hi! My name is Otto, aka
        <a href="https://spiritwaves.bandcamp.com/">Spirit Waves</a>, aka
        tomoko, aka <a href="https://youtube.com/@okomot/">okomot</a> (that's a
        whole bunch of aliases), and today, [date], is a red letter day, as it
        is the day that I finally relaunch SMILEHOUSE!
      </p>
      <p>
        SMILEHOUSE has an interesting history. Initially an off-shoot for things
        unfitting for release on the currently defunct
        <a href="visualdisturbances.net">Visual Disturbances</a>, with a very
        deliberate intention to essentially "send things out to die" via simply
        uploading a single zip and posting a link to a Twitter account, it now
        seems a fitting time for it to take on a life of its own.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have decided to turn SMILEHOUSE into my own personal brand and label.
        With Visual Disturbances on a very indefinite and potentially permanent
        hiatus (at least labelwise, we still function as a now private community
        of close friends), I found myself really missing label work. I just
        plain love it. I love helping people release their music into the world,
        offering support, guidance, and encouragement, and cultivating a
        community of likeminded folks who are really intrigued by all of the
        stuff that's happening around them. For me, it was only a matter of time
        before I tried to start something up again, so I'm pleased to announce
        that the day has finally come. After much dreaming and plotting and
        revisiting my inspirations (The Elephant 6 Collective and Young God
        Records are two of the biggest that come to mind), it just feels right.
        SMILEHOUSE lives once more.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who were part of the Visual Disturbances community, you'll be
        pleased to know that you'll likely see familiar faces as well as a
        similar ethos, and a lot of similar concepts. It would be silly to not
        mention the connection as I think it will be pretty obvious. But, that
        being said, SMILEHOUSE, while being born from the ashes of Visual
        Disturbances, will also hopefully be charting its own unique course.
        There is no intention to simply make this "VD 2.0", despite much of the
        DNA of Visual Disturbances being present. Most of the similarities are
        because I am still friends with most of the same people, and I still
        have many of the same ideas about how to run a label that I had back
        then, but do not fear, as there are also new ideas, and over time you
        will start to see those come to fruition... You can't really spend seven
        or so years running a label and not expect to learn a thing or two, and
        I really hope to put those lessons into practice. Above all, I want
        SMILEHOUSE to be a thing that is built in collaboration with the people
        who opt to be part of it, and to serve as a platform from which we can
        all make our creative voices heard. That's the kind of beautiful, sappy,
        ambitious notion that I want to guide us wherever this new undertaking
        may lead.

        For now, the first orders of business are to establish the community and
        release great music. The music page details the legacy of SMILEHOUSE
        thus far. You can find us on
        <a href="https://twitter.com/_smilehouse">Twitter</a>. As always, I'd
        love to hear your music, so if you have any you'd like to send for
        consideration, get in touch with
        <a href="mailto:star@smilehou.se">star@smilehou.se</a>.

        Thanks for reading. There's more to come, so stay tuned. In the
        meantime, why not hop into our IRC and introduce yourself?
